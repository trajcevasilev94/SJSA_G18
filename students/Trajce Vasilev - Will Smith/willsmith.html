        <p><b>Early life</b></p>
        <hr />
        
        <p>Smith was born on September 25, 1968, in Philadelphia, to Caroline (n√©e Bright), a Philadelphia school board administrator, and Willard Carroll Smith Sr. a U.S. Air Force veteran and refrigeration engineer. His mother graduated from Carnegie Mellon University. 
            He grew up in West Philadelphia's Wynnefield neighborhood, and was raised Baptist. He has an older sister named Pamela and two younger siblings, twins Harry and Ellen. Smith attended Our Lady of Lourdes, a private Catholic elementary school in Philadelphia, followed by Overbrook High School.
            His parents separated when he was 13, but did not actually divorce until around 2000. 
            Smith began rapping at the age of 12. When his grandmother found a notebook of his lyrics, which he described as containing "all [his] little curse words", she wrote him a note on a page in the book, which read, "Dear Willard, truly intelligent people do not have to use words like this to express themselves.
            Please show the world that you're as smart as we think you are". Smith said that this influenced his decision not to use profanity in his music.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </p>
